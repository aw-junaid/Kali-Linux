Nikto is a free and open-source web server scanner. It's designed to identify potential security problems, outdated server software, and misconfigurations in web servers.  It's a valuable tool for performing web application vulnerability assessments.

**What Nikto Does:**

Nikto scans web servers for a wide range of issues, including:

*   **Outdated Server Software:** Identifies outdated versions of web servers and related software (e.g., Apache, Nginx, PHP).
*   **Default Credentials:** Checks for default usernames and passwords.
*   **Misconfigurations:** Detects misconfigurations in the web server settings (e.g., directory listing enabled, insecure HTTP methods allowed).
*   **Vulnerable Scripts:** Identifies known vulnerabilities in common web applications and scripts.
*   **Missing Security Headers:** Checks for the presence of important security headers (e.g., HSTS, X-Frame-Options).
*   **And much more:** Nikto has a large and constantly updated database of checks.

**Key Features and Capabilities:**

*   **Comprehensive Scanning:** Performs a wide range of security checks.
*   **Plugin-Based:** Uses plugins to extend its functionality.
*   **Customizable:** Allows you to customize the scan.
*   **Reporting:** Can generate reports in various formats.
*   **Regular Updates:** The database of checks is regularly updated.

   ```

### Important options:

**Target Specification:**

*   `-host <host>` or `-url <url>`:  *Required*. Specifies the target host or URL.  Use `-h` or `-url` followed by the hostname, IP address, or full URL (including `http://` or `https://`).
*   `-port <port>`: Specifies the port number.  Defaults to 80 (HTTP) if `-ssl` is not used, or 443 (HTTPS) if `-ssl` is used.  Use this if the target is on a non-standard port.
*   `-ssl`: Forces SSL mode.  Use this for HTTPS targets.

**Output and Reporting:**

*   `-output <filename>`: Saves the output to a file.  You can also specify the format using `-Format`.
*   `-Format <format>`: Specifies the output format: `csv`, `json`, `htm`, `nbe`, `sql`, `txt`, `xml`.
*   `-v`: Verbose output.  Use this for more detailed information.
*   `-Display <options>`: Controls what information is displayed.  For example, `-Display 1` shows redirects, `-Display 2` shows cookies, etc.  `-Display D` is for debug output.
*   `-nointeractive`: Disables interactive features.

**Scanning Options:**

*   `-Plugins <plugins>`: Specifies which plugins to run.  By default, Nikto runs all plugins.  You can specify a comma-separated list of plugins.  Use `-list-plugins` to see available plugins.
*   `-Tuning <tuning>`:  Allows you to select specific tests based on their type (e.g., `-Tuning 1` for interesting files, `-Tuning 2` for misconfigurations, `-Tuning x` for all except specified).
*   `-mutate <mutation>`: Enables different mutation techniques for guessing file and directory names.
*   `-maxtime <time>`: Sets a maximum time for the scan (e.g., `1h`, `60m`, `3600s`).
*   `-timeout <seconds>`: Sets the timeout for requests.
*   `-no404`: Disables Nikto's attempt to guess a 404 page.
*   `-404code <codes>`: Ignore HTTP codes as negative responses.
*   `-404string <string>`: Ignore a string in the response body as a negative response.
*   `-followredirects`: Follow 3xx redirects.
*   `-usecookies`: Use cookies received in responses for subsequent requests.

**Evasion Techniques:**

*   `-evasion <techniques>`: Enables various evasion techniques to try to bypass firewalls and intrusion detection systems.  These include things like URL encoding, changing case, and using different request spacers.

**Authentication:**

*   `-id <id:pass>`: Specifies authentication credentials.  Use this if the target requires authentication.

**Other Options:**

*   `-config <file>`: Uses a specific configuration file.
*   `-dbcheck`: Checks the Nikto database for errors.
*   `-list-plugins`: Lists all available plugins.
*   `-update`: Updates the Nikto database.
*   `-Version`: Prints the Nikto version.
*   `-help` or `-Help`: Displays this help message.



## **üõ†Ô∏è Basic Usage**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Scan a Web Server**
```bash
nikto -h http://example.com
```
üîπ Scans `example.com` for known vulnerabilities.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Scan with SSL/TLS Enabled**
```bash
nikto -h https://example.com
```
üîπ Adds SSL/TLS support for HTTPS sites.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Scan a Specific IP**
```bash
nikto -h 192.168.1.10
```
üîπ Scans a target web server using an **IP address**.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Scan a Specific Port**
```bash

**Key Concepts:**

*   **Plugins:**  Small scripts that perform specific checks.
*   **Database:**  A collection of checks and vulnerabilities.

**Use Cases:**

*   **Web Application Vulnerability Assessment:** Identifying security weaknesses in web applications.
*   **Penetration Testing:** As part of the reconnaissance phase.
*   **Security Auditing:**  Checking the security posture of web servers.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **False Positives:** Nikto can sometimes report false positives.  It's important to verify the findings.
*   **Intrusive Scanning:** Nikto performs active scans, which can be detected.
*   **Ethical Use:** Only use Nikto on systems that you have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized scanning is illegal and unethical.
*   **Regular Updates:** Keep Nikto updated to ensure that you have the latest checks and vulnerability information.  Use the `-update` option regularly.

Nikto is a valuable tool for anyone responsible for the security of web servers and applications.  It helps identify potential security problems and provides recommendations for fixing them.  However, it's essential to use it responsibly and ethically.  Always obtain proper authorization before scanning any target.  Be aware of the limitations of the tool and the potential for false positives.  Verify the findings before taking any action.
