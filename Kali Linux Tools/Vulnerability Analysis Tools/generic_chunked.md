### `generic_chunked`
A well-known fuzzing framework by ImmunitySec. It is likely used for **web server fuzzing**, specifically targeting vulnerabilities in **HTTP chunked encoding handling**.

---

## **üîç What is `generic_chunked`?**  
`generic_chunked` is a part of **SPIKE**, a fuzzer designed to test web servers by sending malformed HTTP requests, particularly using **chunked transfer encoding**.

Chunked encoding vulnerabilities have been exploited in the past (e.g., **Apache's chunked encoding vulnerability - CVE-2002-0392**), making this tool useful for security assessments.

---

### **Command Syntax**
```bash
./generic_chunked target port file.spk skipvariables skipfuzzstring
```
or
```bash
./gwsf target port file.spk skipvariables skipfuzzstring
```

---

### **Parameters**
| Parameter          | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `target`           | The target web server's IP address or hostname.                            |
| `port`             | The port number on which the web server is running (e.g., 80 for HTTP).     |
| `file.spk`         | A `.spk` file containing the fuzzing template or payload.                  |
| `skipvariables`    | The number of variables to skip before starting fuzzing.                   |
| `skipfuzzstring`   | The number of fuzz strings to skip before starting fuzzing.                |

### **Example**
```bash
./gwsf exchange1 80 owa1.spk 0 0
```
- **Target**: `exchange1` (hostname or IP address of the target server).
- **Port**: `80` (HTTP port).
- **File**: `owa1.spk` (fuzzing template file).
- **Skip Variables**: `0` (start fuzzing from the first variable).
- **Skip Fuzz String**: `0` (start fuzzing from the first fuzz string).

---

### **Explanation of Components**

1. **Target**:
   - The web server you want to fuzz. This can be an IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.10`) or a hostname (e.g., `example.com`).

2. **Port**:
   - The port number where the web server is listening. Common ports include:
     - `80` for HTTP.
     - `443` for HTTPS.

3. **File.spk**:
   - A `.spk` file is a fuzzing template used by the tool. It defines the structure of the HTTP request and specifies where to inject fuzzing payloads.
   - These files are typically created using tools like **SPIKE**, a fuzzing framework developed by ImmunitySec (referenced in the URL: http://www.immunitysec.com/spike.html).

4. **Skip Variables**:
   - The number of variables in the `.spk` file to skip before starting fuzzing. This is useful if you want to resume fuzzing from a specific point.

5. **Skip Fuzz String**:
   - The number of fuzz strings to skip before starting fuzzing. This is useful if you want to resume fuzzing from a specific payload.

---

### **How It Works**
1. The tool reads the `.spk` file to understand the structure of the HTTP request.
2. It replaces specific parts of the request (variables) with fuzzing payloads.
3. It sends the modified requests to the target web server.
4. It monitors the server's responses for unexpected behavior, such as crashes or errors, which may indicate vulnerabilities.

---

### **Use Cases**
1. **Vulnerability Discovery**:
   - Identify buffer overflows, injection flaws, or other vulnerabilities in web servers.
2. **Protocol Testing**:
   - Test how a web server handles malformed or unexpected input.
3. **Security Research**:
   - Analyze the behavior of web servers under stress or attack conditions.

---

### **Example .spk File**
A `.spk` file might look like this:
```plaintext
s_readline();
s_string("POST /login HTTP/1.1\r\n");
s_string("Host: ");
s_string_variable("example.com");
s_string("\r\n");
s_string("Content-Length: ");
s_string_variable("100");
s_string("\r\n\r\n");
s_string("username=");
s_string_variable("admin");
s_string("&password=");
s_string_variable("password123");
```
- The `s_string_variable` parts are replaced with fuzzing payloads during execution.

---

### **Dependencies**
- **SPIKE Framework**:
  - The tool likely relies on the SPIKE framework for fuzzing. You may need to download and install SPIKE from ImmunitySec's website: http://www.immunitysec.com/spike.html.

## **‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes**
- **Use Responsibly** ‚ö†Ô∏è  
  - **Only test systems you have permission to audit.**
  - Running fuzzers on unauthorized servers **can be illegal** and may trigger security defenses.
  
- **Install SPIKE First**  
  If you don't have SPIKE installed, you can get it via:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install spike
  ```
  Or manually from:
  ```
  http://www.immunitysec.com/spike.html
  ```

### **üîç Checking for Chunked Encoding Vulnerabilities**
If the server **crashes** or responds with **500 Internal Server Error**, it may be vulnerable.
