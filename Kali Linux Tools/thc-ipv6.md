`thc-ipv6` is a suite of tools for attacking and auditing IPv6 networks. It's part of the THC (The Hacker's Choice) hacking toolkit.  It's a powerful collection of utilities that can be used for various IPv6-related tasks, including network discovery, vulnerability scanning, and exploitation.  It's important to emphasize that `thc-ipv6` should *only* be used for ethical testing and security assessments on networks you own or have explicit permission to test.  Using it against unauthorized networks is illegal and unethical.
